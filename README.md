# metacrafter
Final-project/challenge
Creating, minting, and burning your own custom coin on the Ethereum blockchain using Solidity.

Description of the Project
For this project, you can utilized fundamental functions and variables taught in various modules using Solidity. The primary objective was to develop a token on the Ethereum blockchain and gain proficiency in essential functions like minting and burning tokens, as well as implementing conditional statements to minimize basic errors.

Running the Program
To execute this program, you can utilize Remix, an online Solidity Integrated Development Environment (IDE). To begin, visit the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/.

Once you're on the Remix website, create a new file by clicking on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar. Save the file with a .sol extension (e.g., HelloWorld.sol). After writing the code based on the provided instructions, you can test the code using the "deploy" tab on the left-hand side. You can mint coins, check the total supply, and review balances.

My Learning Experience
I thoroughly enjoyed coding in Solidity. Initially, this concept felt unfamiliar to me, but I believe I have gained a strong understanding of the language and its concepts. I am eager to pursue further modules and courses on MetaCrafters to expand my knowledge.
